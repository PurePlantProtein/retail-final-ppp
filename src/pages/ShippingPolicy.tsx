          <p>Customers are responsible for all applicable import duties, taxes, and customs fees levied by the destination country. These charges are not included in the order total or shipping costs paid to Us.</p>
          
          <p className="mt-3">Shipping Carriers: We partner with reputable carriers such as Australia Post, StarTrack, TNT, or various trusted freight providers. The carrier used will depend on the order size, weight, destination, and shipping method selected.</p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>If a package is returned to us as undeliverable due to an incorrect address provided by you, refusal to accept the delivery, or failure to collect from the carrier, you may be responsible for re-delivery costs.</li>
            <li>For B2B deliveries, ensure authorized personnel are available to receive goods during business hours. Missed deliveries may incur re-delivery fees or require collection from a depot, as per the carrier's policy.</li>
